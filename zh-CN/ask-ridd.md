### I've carefully read every article on the RIDD website, and I truly love RIDD. I'm currently building the RIDD community. However, I have a question: the Base blockchain has very low popularity. Why did RIDD choose Base, and not the BSC blockchain?

Base is Base.

That’s not something you need to worry about. What matters is: How long can your patience last? How much RIDD will you still have in your possession after a few years?
